When creating a django project make sure to do the following steps:

1. Create a local environment for all the packages to be downloaded to
    ex. python -m venv env

2. Activate the environment in the terminal whenever you work on the project
    env\Scripts\activate

3. Install Django using a pip install

4. Create a project in Django
    django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME .
        Make sure to include that period so it is configured correctly.

5. Create the Database
    python manage.py migrate

6. View the project
    python manage.py runserver

7. Start an App
    python manage.py startapp APP_NAME
        A project is organized as a group of individual apps that work together as a whole.

8. Defining Models
    A model tells Django how to work with the data that will stored in the app.
    Add a new model in the models.py script by creating a class and storing all code within
    Make sure to add new models at the top of the INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py

9. Update Database
    It's best to do this every time you make a new method
        Modify the database
            python manage.py makemigrations APP_NAME
        Migrate the database
            python manage.py migrate

10. Setting Up a Superuser
    python manage.py createsuperuser
        Grants access to everything within the app


NOTES
- To view the project
    python manage.py runserver

- To enter the Django shell
    python manage.py shell
